# Interest
The Visual Basic form will display year, simple and compound interest.

1. Since I've already code all input into the program,
the user will only have to click on the "Display Growth of Money" button
2. The Output will show the user Years 1-9, Simple Interest for all 9 years,
as well as the Compund Interest for those 9 years.
3. The form is on loop so, if the user continues to press the button,
it will generate the same information multiple times until the user stops and/or exits 
the form.
